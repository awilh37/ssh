Web-Based SSH Server - Conceptual Example
ðŸš¨ CRITICAL SECURITY WARNING ðŸš¨
This code is a non-functional, conceptual example intended for educational purposes ONLY. It is riddled with severe security vulnerabilities and is NOT safe for any form of use beyond academic study.

DO NOT, under any circumstances, run this code on a public-facing server or use it to connect to sensitive systems.

Major Security Flaws in This Example:
Hardcoded Credentials: The server.js file contains a hardcoded username and password. This is one of the most severe security mistakes possible. In a real-world scenario, this would lead to an immediate and total compromise of the target server.

No Authentication/Authorization: The server has zero user authentication. Anyone who can access the web page can open an SSH session to the target machine.

Unencrypted Transport: The example does not enforce HTTPS or Secure WebSockets (WSS). All traffic between the browser and the gateway server can be intercepted on the network.

Inadequate Logging: The logging is minimal and completely insufficient for any security auditing or forensic analysis.

No Host Key Verification: The SSH client does not verify the host key of the target server, making it vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks between the gateway and the target.

Vulnerable to Denial of Service: There is no rate-limiting or resource management, making the server easy to crash with a flood of connection requests.

What Should You Use Instead?
For secure, production-ready remote access, use established and audited open-source or commercial solutions. Building your own is extremely risky. Consider these alternatives:

Apache Guacamole: A powerful open-source clientless remote desktop gateway.

Teleport: A modern, identity-aware access plane that uses short-lived SSH certificates instead of passwords or keys.

By proceeding to run this code, you acknowledge that you understand these risks and that you are doing so in an isolated, controlled environment for learning purposes only.
